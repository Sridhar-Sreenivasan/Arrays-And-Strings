# C++ Array and String Manipulations

## Aim: To study and implement different operations on arrays and strings in C++.

## Tools: GNU g++ compiler (for local execution), Any code editor or an Online C++ Compiler.

# Theory:

In C++, arrays and strings are important data structures used for storing and manipulating multiple data items in a single variable. Arrays store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type, while strings are used to store sequences of characters. This document covers various operations like printing elements of an array, searching an array, calculating the sum and average of array elements, finding minimum and maximum values, string reversal, and checking for palindromes.

## Exp-7A: Printing Elements of an Array

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an array `arr[]` with elements `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`.
3. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array.
4. Print each element of the array.
5. End the program.

## Exp-7B: Searching for a Number in an Array

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an array `arr[]` with elements `{6, 980, 4, 0, 6543}`.
3. Ask the user to enter a number to search for.
4. Use a `for` loop to search for the target number in the array.
5. Print if the number is found or not.
6. End the program.

## Exp-7C: Calculating Sum and Average of Array Elements

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an array and input `n` (number of elements).
3. Use a `for` loop to input elements into the array.
4. Calculate the sum of elements using a loop.
5. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by `n`.
6. Print the sum and average.
7. End the program.

## Exp-7D: Finding Minimum and Maximum Elements in an Array

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an array and input `n` (number of elements).
3. Initialize `min` and `max` as the first element of the array.
4. Use a `for` loop to compare each element of the array with `min` and `max`.
5. Print the minimum and maximum values.
6. End the program.

## Exp-7E: Printing a String in C++

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare a string using a character array `str1` and a `std::string` object `str2`.
3. Print both strings.
4. End the program.

## Exp-7F: Concatenating Two Strings

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare two `std::string` variables `str1` and `str2`.
3. Concatenate `str1` and `str2` using the `+` operator.
4. Print the concatenated result.
5. End the program.

## Exp-7G: Reversing a String

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare a `std::string` variable `str` with the value `"itnagahC ardnejaR"`.
3. Use a `for` loop to reverse the string by swapping characters.
4. Print the reversed string.
5. End the program.

## Exp-7H: Checking if a String is a Palindrome

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare a `std::string` variable `str` with the value `"madam"`.
3. Use a `for` loop to compare the characters of the string.
4. If any character does not match, print that the string is not a palindrome and exit.
5. If the string is a palindrome, print that it is a palindrome.
6. End the program.

## Conclusion:

In this lab, we have learned the concepts of arrays and strings in C++ and implemented several important operations such as printing array elements, searching, finding sum/average, finding min/max values, string concatenation, reversal, and palindrome checking. These operations are foundational for manipulating data in C++ and are widely used in many applications.
